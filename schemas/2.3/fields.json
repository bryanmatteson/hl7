The valid values for the value type of an observation are listed in HL7 table 0125 - Value type. \r\n\r\nThe observation value must be represented according to the format for the data type defined in Chapter 2, Section 2.8, “Data Types.”  For example, a PN consists of 6 components, separated by component delimiters.  \r\n\r\nAlthough NM is a valid type, observations which are usually reported as numbers will sometimes have the string (ST) data type because non-numeric characters are often reported as part of the result, e.g., \u003e300 to indicate the result was off-scale for the instrument.  In the example, \"\u003e300\", \"\u003e\" is a symbol and the digits are considered a numeric value.

CQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units.  SI is invalid because it only applied to HL7 message segments, and ID because it requires a constant field definition. \r\n\r\nThe RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the actual observation value is not sent in OBX but exists somewhere else.  For example, if the observation consists of an image (document or medical), the image itself cannot be sent in OBX.  The sending system may in that case opt to send a reference pointer.

This important information, together with the information in OBR-29-parent number, uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to this order.  The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports.  For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run.  This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization.\r\n\r\nThe third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly.  The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture. \r\n\r\nWe emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent.  It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified.  This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs. \r\n\r\nThis field is present only when the parent result is identified by OBR-29-parent number and the parent spawns child orders for each of many results.  (See Chapter 7 for more details about this linkage.) \r\n\r\nA second mode of conveying this information is to use a standard observation result segment (OBX).  If more than one organism is present, OBX-4-subID is used to distinguish them.

This attribute distinguishes concentrations from total amounts, molar concentrations from mass concentrations, partial pressures from colors, and so forth.  These are discussed more fully in the LOINC Users’ Manual.1  They are derived from the approach described in 1995 edition of the IUPAC Silver Book. These distinctions are used in IUPAC and LOINC standard codes.  Defined categories are listed in HL7 table 0254 - Kind of quantity. \r\n\r\nThe distinctions of true quantities in this table are based primarily on dimensional analyses. The table contains a number of “families,” those related to simple counts (number, number concentration, etc.), to mass (mass, mass concentration, etc.), to enzyme activity (catalytic content, catalytic concentration, etc.), and molar or equivalents (substance content, substance concentration).   \r\n\r\nBy this classification, a glucose (in the US) would be classed as a mass concentration. A sodium would be classed as a substance concentration. Within the family, a total amount should be described as the unadorned variant; e.g., the property of measure for a patient’s weight would be mass, not mass content.  Most chemical measures produce concentrations, as exemplified by sodium and glucose. However, a 24hour urine protein is not a mass concentration, but a mass rate (mass per unit time).  The content variants (e.g., mass content, substance content) are used to reflect an amount per mass (usually) of tissue. \r\n\r\nThis attribute would be valued in a master file only if the service sending the master file classified observations by their principle of measurement.
