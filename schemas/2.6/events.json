To face budget challenges, healthcare organizations need materials management systems that integrate with finance to automate logistics, eliminate paperwork and analyze data to improve efficiency and reduce overall costs.  This process is a major contributor to improving the customers' bottom line by helping to eliminate materials waste, streamline ordering, ensure accurate payment of materials purchased, ensure accurate billing for materials used, and an accurate presentation of the financial statements of a healthcare facility.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_08"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MFI","name":"MFI","longName":"Master File Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"","name":"MATERIAL ITEM RECORD","longName":"","sequence":"","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"MFE","name":"MFE","longName":"Master File Entry","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ITM","name":"ITM","longName":"Material Item","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"","name":"STERILIZATION","longName":"","sequence":"","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"STZ","name":"STZ","longName":"Sterilization Parameter","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"","name":"PURCHASING VENDOR","longName":"","sequence":"","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"VND","name":"VND","longName":"Purchasing Vendor","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"","name":"PACKAGING","longName":"","sequence":"","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PKG","name":"PKG","longName":"Packaging Segment","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PCE","name":"PCE","longName":"Patient Charge Cost Center Exception","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]},{"id":"","name":"MATERIAL LOCATION","longName":"","sequence":"","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IVT","name":"IVT","longName":"Material Location","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ILT","name":"ILT","longName":"Material Lot Segment","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]},{"id":"MFN_M17","msgStructId":"MFN_M17","eventDesc":"DRG Master File","description":"This section is specifically concerned with describing a master file message that should be used to transmit information which identifies the DRG basic information, such as relative weight, lower and upper trim points, etc.\r\n\r\nThe DMI segment must be preceded by the MFI and MFE segments, as described in Section 8.5, GENERAL MASTER FILE SEGMENTS.

A delete trigger event should only be used when an appointment has been erroneously scheduled.  It must be removed from the schedule so that it does not affect any statistical processing.  A delete trigger event differs from a cancel trigger event in that a delete acts to remove an error, whereas a cancel acts to prevent a valid request from occurring.  This trigger event should not be used for any appointment that has already begun, or that has already been completed.  Likewise, it should not be used for any parent appointment if any child appointments have either begun or been completed.\r\n\r\nThe delete trigger event should be implemented with careful forethought, as it typically has different effects and repercussions in various applications.  In some applications, a delete event cannot be undone.  This means that if a delete transaction was sent erroneously, recovery will be difficult or impossible.  In other applications, a delete transaction will not result in the physical deletion of the record(s), but will set a status or a flag.  In these cases, the filler and/or placer appointment identifiers (the numbers or codes that uniquely identify the scheduled appointment or request to the placer and filler applications) probably cannot be reused.

This transaction can be used either to discontinue the blocked status on the schedule, or to reverse a previous block made in error.

Therefore, a separate discontinue block transaction is not necessary.

A delete trigger event differs from a cancel trigger event in that a delete acts to remove an error, whereas a cancel acts to prevent a valid request from occurring.

In some applications, a delete event cannot be undone.  This means that if a delete transaction was sent erroneously, recovery will be difficult or impossible.  In other applications, a delete transaction will not result in the physical deletion of the record(s), but will set a status or a flag.  In these cases, the filler and/or placer appointment identifiers (the numbers or codes that uniquely identify the scheduled appointment or request to the placer and filler applications) probably cannot be reused.
