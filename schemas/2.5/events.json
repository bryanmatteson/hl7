When this \"give\" (i.e., administration) information needs to be transmitted from the pharmacy or treatment application to another application, it is done with the RGV message. \r\n\r\nThe RGV message uses the RXG segment to record drug or treatment administration instructions.  It may carry information about a single scheduled administration on a drug or treatment, or it may carry information about multiple administrations.  If the pharmacy or treatment application (or some other application) needs to create a nonambiguous MAR report where each administration is matched to a particular give date/time instruction, it may use the RGV message as described in the following way: \r\n\r\nFor each scheduled administration of the medication, the pharmacy/treatment issues either a single RGV message or a single RGV message with multiple RXG segments, one for each scheduled administration.  The actual administrations (transmitted by one or more RAS messages) are matched against the scheduled ones by recording in each RXA segment the Give Sub-ID of the corresponding RXG segment.  If more than one administration needs to be matched (as in the case of recording a change or rate of an IV solution) the administering application issues additional RXA segment(s) (corresponding to the same RXG segment).  If no matching is needed, the Give Sub-ID of the RXA segments has the value zero (0).

This transaction can be used either to discontinue the blocked status on the schedule, or to reverse a previous block made in error.  For the purposes of this transaction, discontinuing a block currently in progress (the blocked period has started, but not yet completed) and canceling a blocked period in the future are not significantly different.  Therefore, a separate discontinue block transaction is not necessary.  If this transaction is received prior to the inception of a blocked period, then the entire block period is simply canceled according to the data provided in the transaction.  If the transaction is received after the blocked period has begun, but prior to the end of the blocked period, then the blocked period is discontinued according to the data provided in the transactions.  Applications may decide how to handle transactions that attempt to open a blocked period that has both started and ended in the past; however, these transactions can generally be ignored.
