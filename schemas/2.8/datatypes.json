Assuming that fields that utilize this data type repeat and that Y represents the specific repetition, the components of the repetition will reflect sample Y from each channel.\r\n\r\nUsage Note: The MA data type is preferred when the signal recording device outputs the waveform data by time (all signal amplitudes at time sample 1, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 2, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 3, etc.). The typical count is 32, 64, or 128 channels. At the time of this writing, the MA data type is the one used by most commercial EEG instruments, while other electrophysiological instruments (such as evoked potential instruments) may use the NA data type. The MA data type is the \"natural\" one for multi-channel EEG instruments since the signal acquisition process involves digitizing each channel in succession as rapidly as possible, then after a fixed interval (like 0.004 seconds) digitizing all the channels again in succession, and repeating this every 0.004 seconds as long as the recording continues.\r\n\r\nConversion of one format to another is often not possible or desirable in near-real-time applications. For example, a long-term EEG recording may go on for 24, 48, 72, or more hours and implementations cannot wait until the recording is ended to transmit the data because physicians need to review the waveforms as the recording is in progress; this is why it only makes sense to organize the data by the MA data type which sends the data one time sample after the next.\r\nNote that, visually, the NA and MA data types are indistinguable: they both appear as a series of numeric components.  They are distinguished by context, particularly when used in OBX.5 where the data type is specified in OBX.3.\r\nUse Case: Commercial EEG instruments\r\n\r\nExample 1: 3 channels (identical), 6 time-samples\r\n|0^0^0~1^1^1~2^2^2~3^3^3~4^4^4~5^5^5|\r\n\r\nExample 2: 1 channel, 11 time-samples\r\n|0~1~2~3~4~5~6~7~8~9~10|",

The specific data representations used in the HL7 encoding rules are compatible with ISO 8824-1987(E).\r\nNote that if the time zone is not included, the time zone defaults to that of the local time zone of the sender. Also note that a DTM valued field with the HHMM part set to \"0000\" represents midnight of the night extending from the previous day to the day given by the YYYYMMDD part.\r\n\r\nThe HL7 Standard strongly recommends that all systems routinely send the time zone offset but does not require it. All HL7 systems are required to accept the time zone offset, but its implementation is application specific. For many applications the time of interest is the local time of the sender. For example, an application in the Eastern Standard Time zone receiving notification of an admission that takes place at 11:00 PM in San Francisco on December 11 would prefer to treat the admission as having occurred on December 11 rather than advancing the date to December 12.\r\n\r\nNote: The time zone [+/-ZZZZ], when used, is restricted to legally-defined time zones and is represented in HHMM format.\r\n\r\nOne exception to this rule would be a clinical system that processed patient data collected in a clinic and a nearby hospital that happens to be in a different time zone. Such applications may choose to convert the data to a common representation. Similar concerns apply to the transitions to and from daylight saving time. HL7 supports such requirements by requiring that the time zone information be present when the information is sent. It does not, however, specify which of the treatments discussed here will be applied by the receiving system. \r\n\r\nThe DTM data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the DTM data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of dates and times. \r\n\r\nUnless otherwise specified in the context where the DTM type is used, the DTM type may be truncated to a day. When a DTM is truncated, the truncated form SHALL still be a valid DTM type. Systems should always be able to persist full date / time information including the timezone.

This data type provides a way to define repeat pattern codes \"on the fly\". The repeat pattern code is equivalent to the TQ data type, component 2, sub-component 1 (repeat pattern). The additional components define the meaning of the repeat pattern code. Components 2 - 10 are used to define relatively simple repeat patterns. Component 11 is provided to define complex repeat patterns. This data type forms a bridge between the 2.x Repeat Pattern concept from Quantity/Timing, and the Version 3.0 GTS General Timing Specification. Component 1 is the 2.x concept of repeat pattern. Components 2-7 are derived from the version 3.0 data type PIVL. Components 8-10 are derived from the version 3.0 EIVL data type. If a repeat pattern cannot be defined using components 2-10, then component 11, General Timing Specification is provided. This allows the full literal form of the version 3.0 GTS to be specified.\r\n\r\nWhen using the RPT, if an application doesn't recognize the code in component 1, then it may attempt to determine the appropriate frequency using the remaining components. If the application does recognize the code in component 1, the application is not required to determine the frequency from the remaining components.\r\nUse Case: The use case supporting this proposal is the need to define repeat patterns on the fly while placing an order. The TQ data type did not have the capability to define the meaning of a repeat pattern on the fly. To get around this problem, vendors have implemented a variety of solutions to solve this issue. One way was to add Z-components to the TQ data type to transmit information about the repeat pattern. Another solution was to attempt to parse the repeat pattern code in an attempt to decipher what the code meant.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n|Q1H\u0026Every 1 Hour\u0026HL7xxx^^^^1^h|\r\n|Q2J2\u0026Every second Tuesday\u0026HL7xxx^DW^2^^2^wk|\r\n|BID\u0026Twice a day at institution specified times\u0026HL7xxx^^^^12^h^Y|\r\n|QAM\u0026Every morning at the institution specified time\u0026HL7xxx^HD^00^11^1^d^Y|\r\n|QHS\u0026Every day before the hours of sleep\u0026HL7xxx^^^^1^d^^AHS|\r\n|ACM\u0026Before Breakfast\u0026HL7xxx^^^^^^^ACM|",

        "description": "The basic definition of the HD is that it identifies an (administrative or system or application or other) entity that has responsibility for managing or assigning a defined set of instance identifiers (such as placer or filler number, patient identifiers, provider identifiers, etc.). This entity could be a particular health care application such as a registration system that assigns patient identifiers, a governmental entity such as a licensing authority that assigns professional identifiers or drivers’ license numbers, or a facility where such identifiers are assigned.\r\n\r\nThe HD is designed to be a more powerful and more general replacement for the application identifier of HL7 versions 2.1 and 2.2. It adds two additional components, the \u003cuniversal ID\u003e and the \u003cuniversal ID type\u003e to the former application ID (which is renamed more generically to be the namespace ID).\r\n\r\nIn the case where an HD identifies an entity that assigns/creates instance identifiers such as a particular patient registration system, it defines an \"assigning authority\". In the case where an HD identifies a location where instance identifiers are given out (although they may be created by another entity at another location) such as a particular \"department of motor vehicles office location,\" it defines an \"assigning facility\". These two different uses of the HD appear in many of the extended data types.\r\n\r\nThe \"assigning authority\" defined by the HD is similar in its role to the coding system (and version) part of the coded element data types: both identify a set of more discrete instance identifiers. The difference is that the set of HD-defined discrete instances contain identifiers of \"real-world\" things such as patient or clinical orders, while the coded element-defined set of discrete instances contains concept identifiers (codes).\r\n\r\nThe HD is designed to be used either as a local identifier (with only the \u003cnamespace ID\u003e valued) or a publicly-assigned identifier, a UID (\u003cuniversal ID\u003e and \u003cuniversal ID type\u003e both valued). Syntactically, the HD is a group of two identifiers: a local identifier defined by the first component and a universal identifier defined by the second and third components. HDs that have defined third components (defined UID types) must have a second component that is unique within the series of IDs defined by that component.\r\n\r\nNote: The HD is used in fields that in earlier versions of HL7 used the IS data type. Thus, a single component HD (only the first component valued) will look like a simple IS data type for older systems expecting a single component in the place of the HD data type.\r\n\r\nIf the first component for the HD data type is present, the second and third components are optional. If the third component is present, then the second must also be present (although in this case the first is optional). The second and third components must either both be valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null). \r\nThis means that if all three components of the HD are valued, the entity identified by the first component is the same as the entity identified by components two and three taken together. However, implementers may choose, by site agreement, to specify that if all three components of the HD are valued, the first component defines a member in the set defined by the second and third components.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nExample 1: ISO example with only the 2nd and 3rd components valued:\r\n|^2.16.840.1.113883.19^ISO|\r\nThe syntax of the second component is defined by the ISO standard for object identifiers, not by HL7 (for which the second component is of the ST data type). Thus the periods (\".\") in the second component are part of the ISO syntax, and are legal by the definition of the HL7 ST data type. \r\n\r\nExample 2: A UUID example\r\n|^478A0114-EBF0-7701-A023-6841FF05731A^UUID|\r\n\r\nExample 3: A DNS example\r\n|^falcon.iupui.edu^DNS|",

This important information, together with the information in OBR-29 - Parent, uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result that identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization.\r\n\r\nWe emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.\r\nThis field is present only when the parent result is identified by OBR-29 - Parent and the parent spawns child orders for each of many results.

Except for the optional leading sign (+ or -) and the optional decimal point (.), no non-numeric ASCII characters are allowed.

Such data would not necessarily be left justified since leading spaces may contribute greatly to the clarity of the presentation to the user. Because this type of data is intended for display, it may contain certain escape character sequences designed to control the display. Escape sequence formatting is defined in Section 2.7, \"Use of escape sequences in text fields\". Leading spaces should be included. Trailing spaces should be removed.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n|  leading spaces are allowed.|\r\n\r\nSince TX data is intended for display purposes, the repeat delimiter, when used with a TX data field, implies a series of repeating lines to be displayed on a printer or terminal. Therefore, the repeat delimiters are regarded as paragraph terminators or hard carriage returns (e.g., they would display as though a CR/LF were inserted in the text (DOS type system) or as though a LF were inserted into the text (UNIX style system)).\r\n\r\nA receiving system would word wrap the text between repeat delimiters in order to fit it into an arbitrarily sized display window but start any line beginning with a repeat delimiter on a new line.\r\n\r\nTo include alternative character sets, use the appropriate escape sequence. See Chapter 2, section 2.14.9.18, \"MSH-18 - Character Set\" and section 2.14.9.20, \"MSH-20 - Alternate Character Set Handling Scheme\".\r\n\r\nThis specification applies no limit to the length of the TX data type, either here where the data type is defined, or elsewhere where the data type is used. While there is no intrinsic reason to limit the length of this data type for semantic or syntactical reasons, it is expected that some sort of limitation will be imposed for technical reasons in implementations. HL7 recommends that implementation length limits be published in implementation profiles.",
